\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we proposed a decision tree based method for query construction
targeted at job search and recommendations at LinkedIn. We detailed techniques
to convert member activities and query logs into query clauses. These query cl

In this work, we detailed techniques used to solve the query construction problem 
via decision trees. We developed an offline replay framework which can be
leveraged to construct a decision tree based on query logs and member
activities. We developed an algorithm to convert the decision tree into query
clauses. These query clauses can be used to construct an efficient search or
recommendations query. Such a query construction helped us reduce the latency
by over {\bf 67\%} while maintaining the quality metrics. The techniques
detailed in this work has been A/B tested with live production traffic and has
been ramped to 100\% of LinkedIn users.
