\section{Deployment Lessons}

When we changed the query construction, our first set of experiments were not
successful. While debugging the issue, we found that ranking also changed
significantly. This is due to the fact that the underlying model was trained on
data generated by a different query construction. We then retrained our
model and found it to be successful. Whenever we change pre retrieval stage
significantly, we need to retrain the model. This pattern has been observed
repeatedly.

Biases in training data can also play a significant role in overall model
quality. We perform top K randomization and measure our offline models in job
search against this data. We have found tighter correlation between offline and
online metrics by using unbiased data.
